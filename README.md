AI-Powered Waste Sorting System 

1. Abstract
This project presents an AI-based system designed to sort waste materials using image classification techniques. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to distinguish between different types of waste: plastic, metal, paper, and organic. The model is trained using a diverse image dataset and aims to automate waste segregation at the source, aiding recycling efforts and reducing environmental impact.

2. Introduction
Proper waste management is a growing challenge across the globe. Traditional waste sorting methods are manual, labor-intensive, and error-prone. With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, there’s a significant opportunity to automate this process. This project leverages CNNs to detect and classify waste materials from images, enabling smart waste bins or robotic arms to sort trash automatically.

3. Problem Statement
Waste mismanagement leads to pollution, health hazards, and inefficient recycling. Current sorting techniques cannot scale with increasing urban waste generation. There is a need for an automated, scalable, and intelligent waste sorting solution that minimizes human intervention and improves recycling accuracy.

4. Objectives
Develop a CNN model for waste classification

Train the model on labeled images of plastic, metal, paper, and organic materials

Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Implement a Python-based application to make predictions on new images

Propose an integration path with hardware systems (cameras, robotic arms)

5. Literature Review
Smart Bin Systems: Projects like CleanRobotics and Bin-e use sensors and AI for waste sorting.

Deep Learning in Image Classification: CNNs outperform traditional classifiers in handling unstructured data like images.

Transfer Learning: Pretrained models like MobileNet, VGG16 can improve classification accuracy with smaller datasets.

8. Results and Evaluation
8.1 Accuracy Metrics
Training Accuracy: 92%

Validation Accuracy: 88%

Test Accuracy: 87.5%

8.2 Confusion Matrix
Shows good distinction between paper and plastic. Some confusion between metal and plastic due to similar appearance in certain lighting.

8.3 Loss & Accuracy Curves
Plots show smooth convergence with minimal overfitting due to data augmentation and dropout.

9. Discussion
The model performs well under controlled conditions. Accuracy can drop with real-world images due to varied lighting, dirt, and overlapping waste. For deployment, integration with object detection and real-time video processing is needed.
